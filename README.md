# NL-Regression-Model
This Repo features the progress of creating, testing and tweaking a model for non-linear regression. 

## What's the Model Idea?
I want to try and see how a DenseNet like Model would perform for non-linear regression. In order for that i changed the convolutional and maxpooling layers for fully connected layers. 

## Information
Be aware that the model is not finished or trained yet.
